    <h4><em>Introduction to Rock Music</em></h4>
    <p>Oh, yeah. You know the feeling. Loud guitars, screaming vocals, thundering bass, and pounding drums. Enough decibels to blow your speakers and melt your eardrums, baby. Hard rock, heavy metal, punk, grunge, thrash, whatever you call it; it's got what you need to feel alive. Once the music starts, the adrenaline begins coursing through your veins and you can't turn back. Here's to loving it loud!</p>
    <p>So, what types of rock are we going to cover? Well, mostly the louder, i.e. "heavier" subgenres of rock music. Generally speaking, most of them do not receive the same amount of radio airplay that Classic Rock, Mainstream Rock, and Pop Rock usually do. These genres will include the following:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li>Hard Rock</li>
      <li>Heavy Metal</li>
      <li>Punk Rock</li>
      <li>Hardcore Punk</li>
      <li>Thrash Metal</li>
      <li>Crossover Thrash</li>
      <li>Doom/Sludge Metal</li>
      <li>Noise Rock</li>
      <li>Stoner Rock</li>
      <li>Grunge Rock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the above list is by no means meant to be exhaustive, it should at least give you an idea of the types of rock music that this website will focus on. Certain vintage and Classic Rock acts may also be covered from time to time, especially those deemed influential to the styles named above.</p>
